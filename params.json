  "body": "### Math Calculator\r\nThis a project that was completed as part of the final in Intro to Java II, a course taken at Miracosta College. Some of the things that was taught in that class was about inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, recursion, and more on how to make things object oriented. This was an expansion of a project I had done in the previous class, however, that one was done in the command line.\r\nSome of the features of this include:\r\n* Solving a quadratic formula - This was done by using some of the functions in the Math class to help solve it. This was done using the quadratic formula.  If the answer was not a whole number it would return the answer in quadratic form.\r\n* Simplify a Radical - With this function able to find out the simplest form of reducing a radical number. It even was able to let you know if you could not simplify the number.\r\n* Solve the sides/angles of a triangle - This was done with advanced mathematical formula that helped get the correct sides and angles of a triangle. This was done by either using the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to solve each side/angles.\r\n* Conversion of Fahrenhiet/Celsius/Kelvin - This was something I had added based on being in physics class. With this tool you are able to converting one degree into the other two.\r\n* Solving Point formula - Some of the formulas for this tool included, finding the distance between two point, or the midpoint.\r\n\r\n### Movie Trailer Project\r\n\r\nThis a project which was completed as part of the Udacity nanodegree. This was done by using python to implement code that would generate a HTML page which displayed movie titles, and gave a link to the trailer of those movies.",
